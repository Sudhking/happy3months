  <div class="rap-poem">
hello pretty lady, the girl i call my baby
fatty patty, with breath thats so stinky sike
i lied i love u but u are still smelly
but its okay because, i still love ur booty
big bootie small waist and a big heart
one day under the blanket we will fart
no goodbye straight goodnight cuz i want u to be the one every single night

how do u like my rap just ignore it  move on to this small poem i wrote for you
first person to make me cry so early
because i would never have shown anyone that side of me
i like to be strong i like to be confident
but with you u made me realise that someone loves me
i dont need to be perfect i just gotta be fifty
cuz my gf completes the other half of me
does that mean shes fifty? her age yes her butt rating yes
but that is 50 outta 10
cuz she my number 1 to 10
look to ur right look to ur left aha get sent

wel shit i started rapping again
coming back i swear i keep falling in love u
again and again
and i want to contoinue everyday
whatever u wanna do whatever u wanna say
it will be us against the world always and
well have everythng we wanted one day
